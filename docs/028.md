I've created a comprehensive solution for your Azure blob storage setup with Terraform. Here's what I've provided:
🏗️ Terraform Configuration (main.tf)

Resource Group: Properly tagged and organized
Storage Account: With versioning and change feed enabled
Blob Container: Private access with secure settings
Two SAS Tokens:

Write SAS: Create/Add/Write permissions only
Read/Delete SAS: Read/List/Delete permissions only


Comprehensive Outputs: All necessary values for testing and usage

🧪 Python Test Suite (test_terraform.py)
A robust testing framework that validates:
Infrastructure Tests

✅ All Terraform outputs generated correctly
✅ Azure naming conventions followed
✅ Resources accessible via generated URLs

Security Tests

✅ HTTPS enforcement on all endpoints
✅ SAS token security parameters
✅ Proper token expiry configuration

Functional Tests

✅ Write SAS can upload/create but NOT read/delete
✅ Read/Delete SAS can read/delete but NOT write/create
✅ Permission boundaries enforced correctly

Integration Tests

✅ Real Azure API operations
✅ Terraform state consistency
✅ End-to-end blob lifecycle testing
📋 Setup Guide (README.md)
Complete documentation including:

Prerequisites and installation steps
Quick start deployment guide
Architecture details and security features
Usage examples with code snippets
Troubleshooting and best practices

🚀 Key Features
Security & Compliance

HTTPS-only access enforced on all SAS tokens
Time-limited tokens with configurable expiry (default 30 days)
Least privilege principle - each token has minimal required permissions
Private container with no public access

Production-Ready

Terraform validation included in test suite
State drift detection to ensure infrastructure consistency
Comprehensive error handling in test scripts
Detailed logging and output for debugging

Flexibility

Configurable variables for all major settings
Multiple Azure regions supported
Customizable naming with validation
Extensible test framework for additional scenarios

🔧 Quick Deployment Steps

Save the Terraform code as main.tf
Initialize Terraform:

bash   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply

Install Python dependencies:

bash   pip install azure-storage-blob azure-identity

Run the test suite:

bash   python test_terraform.py
💡 Advanced Usage Tips
Custom Variables
Create terraform.tfvars to customize:
hclstorage_account_name = "mystorageaccount001"  # Must be globally unique
location = "West US 2"
sas_expiry_days = 60
Production Considerations

The storage account uses Standard LRS replication (cost-effective for dev/test)
For production, consider GRS or ZRS for higher availability
Enable soft delete and point-in-time restore for data protection
Implement lifecycle management policies for cost optimization

Monitoring Integration
The configuration includes tags that make it easy to:

Track costs by environment
Implement governance policies
Set up automated monitoring alerts

This solution provides enterprise-grade infrastructure with comprehensive testing, making it suitable for both development and production environments. The test suite ensures your deployment works correctly and maintains security best practices.
