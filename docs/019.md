I'm using java 17 on gradle / groovy with kafka connect. I'd like to use a SMT with kafka connect. how do I do that?

Okay, let's break down how to use a Single Message Transform (SMT) with Kafka Connect in a Java 17 Gradle/Groovy project. Here's a comprehensive guide covering the key aspects:

1. Understanding SMTs and Kafka Connect

Kafka Connect: A framework for streaming data between Kafka and other systems. Connectors are used to pull data into Kafka (source connectors) or push data out of Kafka (sink connectors).

SMTs (Single Message Transforms): Allow you to modify records within a connector's pipeline before they're written to Kafka (for sources) or after they're read from Kafka (for sinks). SMTs are like a middleware layer that can perform data manipulations like:

Renaming/removing fields

Adding/modifying headers

Data type conversions

Filtering

Routing based on criteria

2. Setting up your Gradle Project

First, let's set up your build.gradle file:

plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
    id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '7.1.2'  // For creating a fat JAR
}

group = 'com.example'
version = '1.0.0'
sourceCompatibility = '17'
targetCompatibility = '17'
mainClassName = 'com.example.smt.ExampleSmt' //  If you create a custom SMT

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://packages.confluent.io/maven/' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.apache.kafka:connect-api:3.6.1'  // Replace with your Kafka Connect version
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:2.0.9'
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.9' // Simple logger (remove if using a different impl)
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.10.0'
    
}

test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}


// for creating a uber/fat jar
shadowJar {
    archiveBaseName = 'my-smt'
    archiveClassifier = ''
    archiveVersion = ''
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': mainClassName
    }
    exclude 'META-INF/*.DSA'
    exclude 'META-INF/*.RSA'
    exclude 'META-INF/*.SF'
}

tasks.withType(Jar) {
    enabled = false
}
Use code with caution.
Groovy
Explanation:

java and application plugins: Standard Java project setup.

shadow plugin: Used to create a single, executable JAR with all dependencies (a "fat JAR"), which is often necessary for deploying SMTs in Kafka Connect.

kafka-connect-api: The Kafka Connect API dependencies are essential for building SMTs. Make sure to use a version compatible with your Kafka cluster's Kafka Connect version.

slf4j-api and slf4j-simple: Logging dependencies, replace slf4j-simple with your logging implementation if you are not using simple.

shadowJar task: Configures the shadow plugin to package all dependencies into a single JAR.

3. Creating a Custom SMT

Here's how to create a basic SMT in Java:

package com.example.smt;

import org.apache.kafka.common.config.ConfigDef;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.connector.ConnectRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Schema;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.data.SchemaBuilder;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Struct;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Transformation;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.util.SchemaUtil;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.util.SimpleConfig;
import java.util.Map;


public class ExampleSmt<R extends ConnectRecord<R>> implements Transformation<R> {

    private static final ConfigDef CONFIG_DEF = new ConfigDef(); // Add config options if necessary
    private static final String PURPOSE = "SMT Example that adds a field";

    private static Schema updatedSchema;
    
    @Override
    public void configure(Map<String, ?> props) {
        final SimpleConfig config = new SimpleConfig(CONFIG_DEF, props);
        // You could extract configuration parameters here if you had any
        updatedSchema = SchemaBuilder.struct()
                                        .name("com.example.connect.transforms.ExampleSchema")
                                        .field("originalValue", Schema.STRING_SCHEMA)
                                        .field("addedField", Schema.STRING_SCHEMA)
                                        .build();
    }


    @Override
    public R apply(R record) {
      if(record.value() == null || record.valueSchema() == null){
          return record;
        }

       final Struct originalValue = (Struct) record.value();

        if (originalValue == null) {
            return record; // If there is no value, do nothing
        }


        Struct valueStruct = new Struct(updatedSchema);
        valueStruct.put("originalValue", originalValue.get("name"));
        valueStruct.put("addedField", "This Value Was Added by the SMT");


        return record.newRecord(
                record.topic(),
                record.kafkaPartition(),
                record.keySchema(),
                record.key(),
                updatedSchema,
                valueStruct,
                record.timestamp()
        );
    }

    @Override
    public ConfigDef config() {
        return CONFIG_DEF;
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        // Resource cleanups
    }
}
Use code with caution.
Java
Explanation:

Transformation<R>: This interface needs to be implemented for any SMT. R is the type of ConnectRecord.

configure(Map<String, ?> props): This method is called when the connector is configured. Here you can process custom config params and build the new schema that will be used by the SMT.

apply(R record): This is the main logic of the transform.

It takes an incoming ConnectRecord.

It checks if the record has a value and valueSchema if any is null the record is not modified.

It reads the original value as a struct.

It constructs a new Struct with the new schema that contains both the original value and the added field.

It creates a new record with the updated value

config(): Returns the configuration definition for this SMT.

close(): Allows releasing of resources after the SMT is shut down.

4. Building the JAR

Navigate to your project's root directory.

Run the following Gradle command:

./gradlew shadowJar
Use code with caution.
Bash
This will create a file named my-smt.jar (or whatever name you set in the shadowJar task) inside build/libs.

5. Deploying and Configuring the SMT

Copy the JAR: Place the my-smt.jar in the Kafka Connect plugin directory on each Kafka Connect worker node (the directory will depend on how you set up Kafka Connect). You will typically find a plugin.path config in the connect-distributed.properties file or similar. It might also be named connect-standalone.properties depending on if you are running in standalone mode.

Example: /opt/kafka/plugins/

Configure the Connector

Here's an example of how to configure your SMT inside your connector configuration. This example is using a file source connector but the idea is the same no matter the source or sink connector.

{
   "name": "file-source-connect",
   "config": {
       "connector.class": "org.apache.kafka.connect.file.FileStreamSourceConnector",
       "tasks.max": "1",
       "file": "/tmp/source.txt",
       "topic": "my-topic",
       "transforms":"smt-example",
       "transforms.smt-example.type": "com.example.smt.ExampleSmt"
      }
}
Use code with caution.
Json
Explanation of the Config:

transforms: Defines the logical name of the SMT you want to use smt-example.

transforms.smt-example.type: Specifies the fully qualified class name of your SMT (including package).

Custom Configurations: If your SMT had custom configs you could add them like so transforms.smt-example.myconfig = "my value"

Restart Connect: You will need to restart the Kafka Connect process for it to pick up the new JAR.

Important Notes:

Error Handling: It's best to implement thorough error handling in your SMT to prevent connect workers from crashing.

Configuration: Using a custom config for your SMT will make it more reusable. You can add additional properties to your SMT's configuration.

Testing: You can create JUnit tests to test the SMT functionality separately.

the message should contain a JSON field named: ProductType
I'd to extract that field value on the SMT

Okay, let's modify the SMT to extract the ProductType field from a JSON message. I'll assume your incoming message has a JSON string as its value, and we want to extract a specific field (e.g., "ProductType") and add it as a new field to the record's value.

Here's the updated code and a breakdown:

1. Updated SMT Code (ExampleSmt.java)

package com.example.smt;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import org.apache.kafka.common.config.ConfigDef;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.connector.ConnectRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Schema;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.data.SchemaBuilder;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.data.Struct;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Transformation;
import org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.util.SimpleConfig;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Map;

public class ExampleSmt<R extends ConnectRecord<R>> implements Transformation<R> {
    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ExampleSmt.class);

    private static final ConfigDef CONFIG_DEF = new ConfigDef();
    private static final String PURPOSE = "SMT Example that adds a field based on a JSON field";
    private static final String JSON_FIELD_NAME = "ProductType";
    private static Schema updatedSchema;
    private final ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();


    @Override
    public void configure(Map<String, ?> props) {
        final SimpleConfig config = new SimpleConfig(CONFIG_DEF, props);
        updatedSchema = SchemaBuilder.struct()
                .name("com.example.connect.transforms.ExampleSchema")
                .field("originalValue", Schema.STRING_SCHEMA)
                .field("productType", Schema.STRING_SCHEMA)
                .build();
    }


    @Override
    public R apply(R record) {
        if (record.value() == null) {
            log.warn("Record has no value. Skipping.");
            return record;
        }

        if (!(record.value() instanceof String)) {
            log.warn("Record value is not a String. Skipping.");
            return record;
        }
        String jsonString = (String) record.value();
        String productType = null;


        try{
           JsonNode jsonNode = mapper.readTree(jsonString);
           JsonNode productTypeNode = jsonNode.get(JSON_FIELD_NAME);

           if(productTypeNode != null && productTypeNode.isTextual()){
              productType = productTypeNode.asText();
           }
           else{
              log.warn("JSON does not contain " + JSON_FIELD_NAME +  "or its not a textual value:" + jsonString);
           }
        }
        catch (IOException e)
        {
            log.error("Error parsing JSON: " + jsonString, e);
            return record; //Return the original record
        }


        Struct valueStruct = new Struct(updatedSchema);
        valueStruct.put("originalValue", jsonString);
        valueStruct.put("productType", productType);

        return record.newRecord(
                record.topic(),
                record.kafkaPartition(),
                record.keySchema(),
                record.key(),
                updatedSchema,
                valueStruct,
                record.timestamp()
        );
    }

    @Override
    public ConfigDef config() {
        return CONFIG_DEF;
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
    }
}
Use code with caution.
Java
Explanation of Changes:

ObjectMapper: Added ObjectMapper from the Jackson library to handle JSON parsing.

Logging: Added a logger to log potential errors and warnings.

configure() method: The schema builder now has a field called productType

apply() method:

JSON Parsing:

It checks if the record.value() is a string before casting.

The mapper.readTree() reads the JSON string into a JsonNode.

It extracts the value associated with the ProductType field.

New Schema:

It now creates a Struct with the new schema that includes:

originalValue - the original JSON string

productType - The value of the ProductType from the JSON.

Logging Log any errors and return the original message in case of errors.

Constants: Added JSON_FIELD_NAME to make the field more configurable.

2. Updated build.gradle

You'll need to add the Jackson dependencies:

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.apache.kafka:connect-api:3.6.1'
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:2.0.9'
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.9'
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.15.2'
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.10.0'
}
Use code with caution.
Groovy
3. How to Use:

Rebuild JAR: Run ./gradlew shadowJar to generate the new my-smt.jar.

Deploy: Copy the new JAR to your Kafka Connect plugin path.

Restart: Restart your Kafka Connect workers.

Connector Configuration: The connector configuration remains the same, as shown before, using the transforms and transforms.<smt_name>.type parameters.

Example Incoming JSON Message:

{
  "name": "My Product",
  "price": 19.99,
  "ProductType": "Electronics",
   "otherField": "someValue"
}
Use code with caution.
Json
Output Record after Transformation:

The output record will have the structure defined in the schema:

originalValue: The original JSON string.

productType: Electronics

Important Considerations:

Error Handling: The code now includes logging for errors and warnings, consider adding more granular error handling depending on the specific needs.

JSON Complexity: If your JSON structures are very complex, using a custom JsonNode to parse specific objects is also viable. You might need to handle arrays, nested structures and so on.

Optional Field: If the JSON doesn't always contain ProductType, ensure that it handles the case where productTypeNode is null.

Let me know if you have more questions about the specifics or you'd like a different scenario.

13.0s
the kafka connect here should read from a kafka topic and write into an elasticsearch 6.8 alias. the alias name depends on the value of the ProductType field value

Okay, let's tackle this more complex scenario. We'll modify the SMT to extract the ProductType from the JSON message and then use that value in a Kafka Connect Elasticsearch sink connector to write data into different Elasticsearch indices (actually, to aliases pointing to different indices) based on the ProductType.

This will require:

SMT to Extract ProductType: We'll keep the SMT from the last response, as it already does the extraction.

Elasticsearch Sink Connector Configuration: We'll configure the Elasticsearch sink to use the SMT and then use the extracted ProductType to dynamically set the Elasticsearch index/alias.

1. Keep the SMT (ExampleSmt.java) from the Previous Response

The SMT we created in the previous response will already do what we need and extract the productType field, no changes are needed for the ExampleSmt.java class.

2. Elasticsearch Sink Connector Configuration

Here's the crucial part - the configuration for your Elasticsearch sink connector:

{
  "name": "elasticsearch-sink-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSinkConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "topics": "your_source_topic",
    "connection.url": "http://your_elasticsearch_host:9200",
    "key.ignore": "true",
    "type.name": "_doc",
    "transforms": "extractProductType",
    "transforms.extractProductType.type": "com.example.smt.ExampleSmt",
    "index.name": "${productType}",
    "behavior.on.malformed.documents": "log",
    "errors.log.enable": "true",
    "errors.tolerance": "all",
     "connection.username": "yourUser",
    "connection.password": "yourPassword"
  }
}
Use code with caution.
Json
Explanation of the configuration:

connector.class: Specifies the Elasticsearch Sink Connector class. Make sure you have this connector plugin installed in your Kafka Connect environment.

topics: The Kafka topic you're reading from.

connection.url: Your Elasticsearch connection URL. Replace with your actual values.

connection.username and connection.password: The username and password to use for authentication with elastic search, depending on your setup you might not need this config.

key.ignore: Indicates that we don't care about the record's key in this scenario.

type.name: The type of the documents, _doc is the standard value for elasticsearch version 7+. For version 6.x you need to define the mapping manually.

transforms: Specifies the logical name (extractProductType in our example) of the transformation we're applying to the records, the name is arbitrary.

transforms.extractProductType.type: Specifies the fully qualified class name of your custom SMT (including the package), make sure that you have packaged the SMT into a jar and deployed to the plugins directory.

index.name: This is where the magic happens!

${productType}: The sink connector will interpret the ${productType} as an expression.

The connector uses the productType field generated by your SMT, so the sink will write the data into a different alias (and consequently different indices) based on each value.

This assumes that each alias corresponds to a separate index. (i.e. If the product type is Electronics then it will write into the electronics alias)

behavior.on.malformed.documents: what to do if there is a malformed document when writing into Elasticsearch. Setting this to log is helpful for debugging.

errors.log.enable and errors.tolerance: Logging and error handling configuration.

Important for Elasticsearch 6.8: You might need to add or adjust other settings depending on your Elasticsearch cluster and the type of documents that you want to send into the index. For example, you might need to add schema.ignore or define a custom mapping.

3. Setting up Elasticsearch Aliases

For this to work effectively, you must ensure you have Elasticsearch aliases created for each ProductType you expect to encounter. This assumes that these are separate indices with an alias that is named after the ProductType.

Example (using Elasticsearch REST API):

# Create index for Electronics
PUT /electronics_index

# Create an alias for it
POST /_aliases
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "add": {
        "index": "electronics_index",
        "alias": "electronics"
      }
    }
  ]
}

# Create an index for Books
PUT /books_index

# Create an alias for it
POST /_aliases
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "add": {
        "index": "books_index",
        "alias": "books"
      }
    }
  ]
}
Use code with caution.
Bash
4. Deployment Steps

Package SMT: Build the my-smt.jar file as described before.

Deploy: Place the my-smt.jar file and the elasticsearch-sink connector jar in their appropriate Kafka Connect plugin directories.

Create Aliases: Make sure your Elasticsearch alias setup is correct before running the connect.

Start Connector: Use the provided configuration to start the Elasticsearch sink connector, as you did before with the file connector.

Important Notes:

Connector Version: Make sure you're using the correct version of the Elasticsearch sink connector that is compatible with your Kafka Connect and Elasticsearch versions.

Dynamic Mapping: If you are using a modern Elasticsearch version, Elasticsearch usually handles the dynamic mapping.

Error Handling: Adjust the error handling options to your preferences and make sure to log any issues.

Permissions: Make sure the Elasticsearch user associated with the connection has enough permissions to create and manage indices and write into them.

JSON String: The source of your Kafka topic must be publishing JSON string messages, if the messages are not strings you might need to parse them using a different SMT or a connector that provides this functionality.

Aliases: This configuration uses aliases that correspond to indices. If you need more dynamic routing based on a more complex rule set, you might need to use a different type of connector or an additional SMT to route the message based on more complex logic.
