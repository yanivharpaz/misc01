test for the `ensureIndexAndAliasExist` method. Since this involves Elasticsearch interactions, we'll need to use either a mocked client or a test container. I'll show you both approaches, but I'll focus on the mocked version first since it's more lightweight.



I've created a comprehensive test class that verifies the index and alias creation functionality. The test class includes two main test cases:

1. `ensureIndexAndAliasExist_CreatesNewIndexAndAlias`: Tests the scenario where neither the index nor alias exists, verifying that both are created properly
2. `ensureIndexAndAliasExist_UsesExistingIndexAndAlias`: Tests the scenario where the index already exists, verifying that no new index is created

Key aspects of the tests:

1. Uses Mockito for mocking Elasticsearch clients
2. Verifies both the high-level and low-level client interactions
3. Checks proper index naming convention (prd_a_<type>_<number>)
4. Verifies alias creation with write index settings
5. Includes argument matchers to verify correct parameters are passed

To use these tests, you'll need to add the following dependencies to your build file if you haven't already:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
    <version>5.8.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
    <artifactId>mockito-junit-jupiter</artifactId>
    <version>4.5.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
